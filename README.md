This extension aims to bring a features of modern IDE for a Common Lisp. The aim is to create an excellent developer experience outside of emacs.

### Basic syntax highlighting!

There are almost no features right now, but the list of things that I would like to support include:

- Syntax highlighting
- REPL
- Code completion
- Code refactoring
- Snippets
- Debugging features
- SLIME-like features
- Easy binary creation with [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)
- Web development tools
- Maybe more?

## Requirements (TBD)

## Working with Markdown (leaving this section for now)

**Note:** You can author your README using Visual Studio Code.  Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
